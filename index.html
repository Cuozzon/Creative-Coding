<h1>Nikki Cuozzo's Creative Coding Portfolio</h1>
<p>This collection showcases my p5.js, HTML, and CSS projects created for a creative coding course. 
   As a beginner, these pieces represent my early steps in turning ideas into code. I still have plenty 
   to learn, but I’m excited to keep growing and developing my skills.</p>

  <h2>Retro Television Clock</h2>
  <img src="Images/Retro Television Clock Image.png" alt="Screenshot of Retro Television Clock">
  <p>A retro TV clock where time is shown using colored balls that fall from the top of the screen, 
     with the largest representing hours, the middle minutes, and the smallest seconds. As the balls 
     descend, their colors fade, and they reset to the top after completing a full hour, minute, or 60 seconds.

  <h2>Trail Walker</h2>
  <img src="Images/Trail Walker Image.png" alt="Screenshot of Trail Walker">
  <p>"Trail Walker" is a single-button hiking-themed game where the player is represented by an orange backpack. 
      The objective of the game is to dodge trees and collect compasses and maps for points.
      If you hit a tree, the game is over.</p>

  <h2>Sylvia's 50,000 Words</h2>
  <img src="Images/Sylvia's 50,000 Words Image.png" alt="Screenshot of Sylvia's 50,000 Words">
  <p>A book inspired by Sylvia Plath, using the titles of all her poems as sentences arranged in random order to give a unique 
     experience on each read. Each chapter is named "Sylvia," and the book is designed with an old, typewriter-like aesthetic to 
     reflect her writing style. I created the title, The Fox with the Glass Teeth, to encompass the feel of her poetry.</p>

  <p>A colorful 8x8 grid of randomly sized and colored circles, rectangles, and triangles. Each shape has a random fill, stroke, 
     and stroke weight, making the artwork unique every time the code runs.</p>
